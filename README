This little Ruby app fetches the public timelines
of all members of an organisation and pushes the
last N results to a gist.

It is originally designed to run on Heroku, taking
advantage of Heroku's scheduler to run the fetcher
every 10 minutes, but it can also be run elsewhere.

The only requirement is to set this environment
variable:

  GITHUB_AUTH="login:password"

Be sure to also read the config.yml file and its
comments. The app code itself isn't very long nor
complex, so read up if you wish.

------------------------------------------------------

There's also a CORS-enabled proxy for the data. Just issue
a GET request to:

    https://ualug-github-feed.herokuapp.com/proxy/feed.<format>

where <format> is one of:

  json    Which is just what the gist contains.
  
  jsonp   Which is the same, but wrapped in a callback
          (and you can define that using the ?callback=...
          parameter, otherwise it's set to "callback").
  
  yaml    Which is the same data, but in YAML format.


If GitHub decides there's somthing wrong with our request
and sends something else than HTTP 200 through, you'll get
the same status code than what we've received, plus the
response body, minus the headers â€” we set those.

If you don't specify a format, or specify a bad format,
you'll get back an HTTP 400, with "bad format" as the body.
