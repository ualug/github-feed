This little Ruby app fetches the public timelines
of all members of an organisation and saves the
last N results to a file, which is then served in
different formats for consumption.

Be sure to also read the config.yml file and its
comments. The app code itself isn't very long nor
complex, so read up if you wish.


The CORS-enabled server for the data:

    GET /github.<format>

where <format> is one of:

  json    Which is just what the gist contains.
  
  jsonp   Which is the same, but wrapped in a callback
          (and you can define that using the ?callback=...
          parameter, otherwise it's set to "callback").
  
  yml    Which is the same data, but in YAML format.

If you don't specify a format, or specify a bad format,
you'll get back an HTTP 400, with "bad format" as the body.
