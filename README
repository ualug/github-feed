This little Ruby script fetches the public timelines
of all members of an organisation and saves the
last N results to a JSON file, which you can then
serve using your server of choice (e.g. NGINX).

Be sure to also read the config.yml file and its
comments. The code itself isn't very long nor
complex, so read up if you wish.
